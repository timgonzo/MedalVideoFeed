# Medal TV React Code Exercise

Thank you for applying to Medal! Congratulations on getting this far into the application process. This exercise is designed to expose our development team to your code style and UI/UX intuitions.

## Specification

We would like to see your version of a video feed. Medal has a video feed, but don't let that dictate your design. We want to see how you would do it using the tools we use everyday. Included in this project is our video player and a json file containing a collection of video objects we support on our platform.

### Requirements
- List all video objects using our video player
- A user should bee able to play the individual videos within the feed

### Technology Requirements
- Use ReactJS
- Use our provided video player, reference the readme file within the zip file for additional information (hint: videoOpts is a required prop). You will not be able to install from Github like described in the  video player readme (it is a private repo), you must use the one included in the zip file.
- The app server must be able to be ran using this command:
  `npm install && npm run start`

### Submitting Work

**DO NOT UPLOAD YOUR SOLUTION TO A PUBLIC GITHUB REPO**

Feel free to clone this repo or download the two required parts (the Medal Video player zip file and videos.json). When you have completed your work, email ken@medal.tv a zip file of your project (please do not include your `node_modules` folder).

#### Can I use tools like NextJS or Create React App?
Yes absolutely, use any tool you would like as long as it allows you to follow the technology requirements.
